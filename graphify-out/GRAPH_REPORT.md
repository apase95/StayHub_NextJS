## Knowledge Gaps
- **23 isolated node(s):** `Guest`, `Host`, `Admin`, `VNPay Payment Gateway`, `High-level Modules` (+18 more)
  These have ≤1 connection - possible missing edges or undocumented components. (Counts symbols only; 23 node(s) total have ≤1 connection when file, concept and rationale nodes are included.)
- **3 thin communities (<3 nodes) omitted from report** — run `graphify query` to explore isolated nodes.

## Suggested Questions
_Questions this graph is uniquely positioned to answer:_

- **Why does `API Design` connect `Payment APIs` to `Roles and Setup`, `API Rules`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.235) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Why does `Booking` connect `Domain Data Model` to `Payment APIs`?**
  _High betweenness centrality (0.232) - this node is a cross-community bridge._
- **Are the 2 inferred relationships involving `VNPay Verification Rules` (e.g. with `VNPay Payment Gateway` and `VNPay IPN Endpoint`) actually correct?**
  _`VNPay Verification Rules` has 2 INFERRED edges - model-reasoned connections that need verification._
- **What connects `Guest`, `Host`, `Admin` to the rest of the system?**
  _23 weakly-connected nodes found - possible documentation gaps or missing edges._
